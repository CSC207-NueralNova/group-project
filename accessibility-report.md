**Principle 1: Equitable Use**
While our application may be more difficult to use for people with visual or speech impediments, some features we could implement that would adhere to this principle could be adding alt text and options for voice input. This would make it easier for people with such disabilities to use our app.

**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**
This design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities because it has websites for both computer and mobile platforms. We also provide pre-inputted questions for the AI advisor, which provides accessible decision-making tools.

**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**
This design has clear navigation with concise wording to avoid ambiguity. The UI keeps the amount of words to a minimum and instead opts for a more balanced mix of words and icons to create an intuitive user experience.

**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**
We use readable fonts and colors that complemented each other for a pleasant viewing experience. We also include support for diverse environments by implementing support for both PC and mobile platforms.

**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**
We minimize errors by checking if the value and date formats are correct. If the value of something inputted is not entered within 2 decimal places, we return a message saying that the input value is invalid, and if the date is not in the format MMYY and valid, then we return a message saying that the input date is invalid.

**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**
We use an intuitive dropdown menu to display certain categories of expenses, which greatly reduces the physical effort needed to navigate the app. We also have pre-inputted questions that the user can ask the AI, which reduces the physical effort of typing in a poorly-worded question and the effort of finding a suitable question to ask about finances.

**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
We use responsive design that can accommodate both mobile and computer platforms. We also present key information on the main page (dashboard), which reduces the need for unnecessary scrolling.

We would market this program to people with simple financial needs/goals. Specifically, we would market this to students or people of the general middle class, as their income is mostly divided along the 50-30-20 rule without too much disposable income. Our AI assistant can only answer so many questions, so while it may not be good for people experienced in managing their money, it would be incredibly useful to college students or young inexperienced adults by providing sample questions to ask. In addition, our sidebar with categories that can be toggled can be very useful to view expenses individually, but is less effective for people with complicated financial goals.

Our program is less likely to be used by people who are generally more wealthy. We donâ€™t believe that there is either tangible or relational harm that results out of upper-class people not finding this app as useful. Because this is a finance app, there is not necessarily any vulnerability with this demographic, because in general they have more money to spend and save compared to the average middle-class worker.
