### Team story

As a young adult, I want to keep track of my budgeting so that I can have a better understanding of my finances.

As a returning user, he is not greeted with the tutorial for new users. He then updated his monthly income with the latest information, and the dashboard visualization dynamically reflects this change. Junior then logs out of the account, returning them to the login page.

### James' Story

James is prompted with a series of questions prior to the signup process. James then chooses either an email password combination, or to login using google authentication. If successful, he is directed to the dashboard page, where he will then be faced with an AI generated tutorial of all the features. He can then add his income input and spending output and generate statistics about his monthly spending.

### Jia Yi's Story

As a student, Clair wants to check how much she’s spent that month so she can plan for the next month.

She logs into SpendSmart and looks at her spending on the dashboard. She decides that she’s been spending too much on eating out so she asks the AI assistant to create a budgeting plan that lowers her expenses on food.

### Anthony's Story

Anthony wants to compare his spending this month with his spending last month.

When Anthony views his statistics for spending for the past three months, he chooses to compare the current month with the previous month, and the app displays overlayed bar and line plots to help him make an educated decision on his spending habits.

### Ysajelle’s story

As a Netflix user, I would like to track my monthly subscription and save it in a category, so that I don't need to add it every month.

Use Cases:
1. Sign in
2. Login
3. Open the "Input" window
4. Input expense
   1. Choose the occurrence of the expense from a dropdown, whether it is a monthly expenses or one-time expense.
   2. Enter the month (format: "MMYY") when that expense occurs or starts.
   3. Enter the amount.
   4. Choose a category for the expense from a dropdown.
5. Submit Expense
   1. Click "Submit button"
   2. An "expense added" message will pop up beside the "Submit" button.

### Annie's Story

Annie has two jobs that she would like to track in SpendSmart.

One of the jobs is a full-time job; the other one is a part-time contract job. She would like to separate the incomes from the two sources to verify that both of them are worth her time. Annie logs in to the SmartSpend account and sets one income type as a full-time (fixed) income with the source marked as her first job. The fixed income has a paycheck twice a month with a fixed amount, which does not need to be updated later on. The other payouts are categorized as part-time (variable) income, where the amount paid each time depends on the month and needs to be inputted every time.
